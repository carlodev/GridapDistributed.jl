@article{Badia2020,
abstract = {Gridap is a new Finite Element (FE) framework, exclusively written in the Julia programming language, for the numerical simulation of a wide range of mathematical models governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). The library provides a feature-rich set of discretization techniques, including continuous and discontinuous FE methods with Lagrangian, Raviart-Thomas, or N{\'{e}}d{\'{e}}lec interpolations, and supports a wide range of problem types including linear, nonlinear, single-field, and multi-field PDEs (see (Badia, Mart{\'{i}}n, {\&} Principe, 2018, Section 3) for a detailed presentation of the mathematical abstractions behind the implementation of these FE methods). Gridap is designed to help application experts to easily simulate real-world problems, to help researchers improve productivity when developing new FE-related techniques, and also for its usage in numerical PDE courses. The main motivation behind Gridap is to find an improved balance between computational performance, user-experience, and work-flow productivity when working with FE libraries. Previous FE frameworks, e.g., FEniCS (Alnaes et al., 2015) or Deal.II (Bangerth, Hartmann, {\&} Kanschat, 2007) usually provides a high-level user front-end to facilitate the use of the library and a computational back-end to achieve performance. The user front-end is usually programmable in an interpreted language like Python, whereas the computational back-end is usually coded in a compiled language like C/C++ or Fortran. Users can benefit from the high-level front-end (i.e., for rapid prototyping) and simultaneously enjoy the performance of the compiled back-end. This approach reaches a compromise between performance and productivity when the back-end provides all the functionality required by the user. However, it does not satisfactorily address the needs of researchers on numerical methods willing to extend the library with new techniques or features. These extensions usually need to be done at the level of the computational back-end for performance reasons.},

This paper presents the extension of the FEniCS software components to the automated solution of finite element formulations of differential equations defined over general, immersed manifolds. We describe the implementation and, in particular detail, how the required extensions essentially reduce to the extension of the FEniCS form compiler to cover this case. The resulting implementation has all the properties of the FEniCS pipeline and we demonstrate its flexibility by an extensive range of numerical examples covering a number of geophysical benchmark examples and test cases. The results are all in agreement with the expected values. The description here relates to DOLFIN/FEniCS 1.2.},

@article{Ronchi1996,
abstract = {A new gridding technique for the solution of partial differential equations in spherical geometry is presented. The method is based on a decomposition of the sphere into six identical regions, obtained by projecting the sides of a circumscribed cube onto a spherical surface. By choosing the coordinate lines on each region to be arcs of great circles, one obtains six coordinate systems which are free of any singularity and define the same metric. Taking full advantage of the symmetry properties of the decomposition, a variation of the composite mesh finite difference method can be applied to couple the six grids and obtain, with a high degree of efficiency, very accurate numerical solutions of partial differential equations on the sphere. The advantages of this new technique over both spectral and uniform longitude-latitude grid point methods are discussed in the context of applications on serial and parallel architectures. We present results of two test cases for numerical approximations to the shallow water equations in spherical geometry: the linear advection of a cosine bell and the nonlinear evolution of a Rossby-Haurwitz wave. Performance analysis for this latter case indicates that the new method can provide, with substantial savings in execution times, numerical solutions which are as accurate as those obtainable with the spectral transform method. {\textcopyright} 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},
